# RealCalculator

This is a calculator built in Android Studio with an iOS 10 inspired UI and function.
It is published on the Google Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=v2.liu.bryan.realcalculator&hl=en 
Current analytics show 30K active users.
Note: only supports Android devices. 

Current analytics show that this app fills a small niche in the app market with it being most popular in developing countries where most users are still running a low version OS such as kit kat. 

It has handy features such as:

- Basic operations ( * / + - ) 

- Easy tax calculation i.e. 1000 * 13 % = 130 

- Plus/Minus 

- Changing operations (accidentally pressing '+' when you meant to press '-')  

- Swiping on the display to delete a number. 

- Scientific Notation 

- Repeated calculation i.e. 2 * 2 (press '=' 4 times) = 32

- Zero division error 

- Integer conversion when applicable i.e. (2.5 + 2.5 = 5)
